# Implementation Plan

This document summarizes the key tasks required to complete the challenge. The sections referenced below contain the relevant instructions from the project documentation.

## 1. Analyze the documentation
- Review **PRD.md** lines 33–46 and 48–52 for the official requirements.
- Read **README.md** lines 36–39 for guidance on how to use the provided data and interviews.
- Note potential rules or quirks mentioned in **INTERVIEWS.md** for later reference.

## 2. Develop the reimbursement algorithm
- Copy `run.sh.template` to `run.sh`.
- Implement the logic so the script accepts `trip_duration_days`, `miles_traveled`, and `total_receipts_amount` and prints only the reimbursement amount. See **README.md** lines 41–59.
- Keep the runtime under five seconds per case and avoid external dependencies.

## 3. Evaluate and refine
- Run `./eval.sh` against `public_cases.json` to check accuracy (see **README.md** lines 68–77).
- Inspect mismatches and iterate on the logic until the output closely matches the expected results.

## 4. Generate results and submit
- Execute `./generate_results.sh` to produce `private_results.txt` as instructed in **README.md** lines 79–86.
- Add `arjun-krishna1` as a collaborator on your repository.
- Submit the repository link and the results file via the provided form.
