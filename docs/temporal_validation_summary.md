# Temporal Structure Validation Summary

This note summarizes how to check whether the reimbursement dataset has any meaningful time component.
It draws on the instructions from `AGENTS.md`, `TASKS.md`, and the linear workflow in
`data-agents/FORECAST_DOC_VALIDATION.md`.

## Steps

1. Run the data loader:
   ```bash
   python data-agents/load_public_cases.py
   ```
   This creates `public_cases.csv` for easier inspection.
2. Look for date, timestamp, or submission-order fields in the CSV.
   The public data only includes `trip_duration_days`, `miles_traveled`,
   and `total_receipts_amount`.
3. Because no time-based fields exist, shuffling the rows does **not**
   change the interpretation. Therefore there is no temporal structure
to model, and the usual forecasting assumptions (stationarity, seasonality,
long history) do not apply.

Treat the reimbursement logic as a deterministic rule-based system. Use
`eval.sh` to refine your algorithm rather than forecasting metrics.
