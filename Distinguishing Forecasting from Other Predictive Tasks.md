Here is a generalized first principles contextual prompt for distinguishing forecasting from other predictive tasks, drawing on the information in the sources:

When approaching a predictive problem, it is crucial to first determine if it is fundamentally a **forecasting problem**. Forecasting is primarily concerned with making informed statements or predictions about future events or conditions that are not yet known. It involves anticipating what has yet to happen, typically by analyzing existing data, identifying patterns or trends, and extrapolating them forward in time. A key element is that forecasts are only needed when there is uncertainty about what will happen.

To determine if your problem is a forecasting problem, consider the following core characteristics and distinctions:

1.  **Is the Data Sequential and Time-Indexed?** A fundamental requirement for forecasting is that the data must be recorded over time with a meaningful chronological order. The order of observations matters inherently in forecasting. If shuffling the data would destroy its meaning, that is a strong sign that time sequence is important.
2.  **Is There Temporal Structure to Exploit?** Forecasting methods rely on the assumption that historical patterns and relationships will persist (at least approximately) into the future. There should be evidence of temporal patterns or dependencies that can be exploited for prediction, such as trends, seasonal cycles, or autocorrelation. If the data were pure noise with no temporal structure, the best forecast would yield little informational gain beyond predicting the long-term mean or last observed value. Forecasting is appropriate when past behavior of the time series is a reasonable guide to its future behavior.
3.  **Are You Predicting Future Numeric Values (or Distributions)?** Forecasting typically produces a **numeric or continuous output** (or a continuous probability or count) for future time points. The goal is to predict what the *value* of a variable will be at a future time. This distinguishes it from other predictive tasks:
    *   **Forecasting vs. Classification:** Classification involves predicting a discrete class label or category. If your outcome is a label (e.g., 'spam'/'not spam', 'churn'/'no churn') rather than a numerical value over time, it's a classification problem. Predicting whether a stock will go up or down tomorrow is a classification task, not a time series forecasting task.
    *   **Forecasting vs. Anomaly Detection:** Anomaly detection identifies unusual observations or patterns that deviate from expected behavior. While often using time series data, the goal is not to predict future values but to evaluate whether current or past values are abnormal. Anomaly detection produces alerts or scores indicating how anomalous points are, not a predicted future sequence.
    *   **Forecasting vs. Regression (General Predictive Modeling):** Standard regression predicts a numerical value based on features, but typically assumes independent examples. Time series forecasting is a **specialized form of regression** where the input variables are ordered by time and predict a *future* value of the same series. If your prediction target is a numerical value that is *not* explicitly a future time-indexed value of the series being analyzed, it's a general regression problem, not a time series forecast.

4.  **Are the Necessary Data Conditions Met?** Forecasting methods often assume or work best when the time series exhibits stationarity (after transformation) or has sufficient historical data.
    *   **Stationarity:** The statistical properties (mean, variance) of the underlying process should not change over time. While raw series may be non-stationary, they should ideally be transformable (e.g., through differencing) so residuals are stationary. If the series is prone to drastic, non-repeating changes (regime changes), standard forecasting models may be questionable.
    *   **Sufficient Data:** Enough historical observations are needed to reliably detect patterns and estimate parameters. Forecasting struggles with extremely short series or completely new situations where no history exists.

In essence, a problem qualifies as a **forecasting problem** when:
*   You have **time-indexed sequential data**.
*   The data exhibits **temporal patterns or dependencies**.
*   The goal is to **predict future values** of that same series.

It is **not a forecasting problem** if:
*   There is **no meaningful temporal order** or the order doesn't matter for the prediction.
*   The goal is to predict a **category or class** (classification).
*   The goal is to identify **irregularities or outliers** (anomaly detection).
*   The prediction is a numerical value but **not explicitly a future time-indexed value** of the series itself (general regression).
*   The data is essentially **random or dominated by non-repeatable events** (low forecastability).

Ultimately, the decision rests on the nature of the data, the specific question being asked, and whether temporal dynamics and structure are central to achieving a reliable prediction. Recognizing when a problem *is* and *is not* a forecasting problem is the critical first step before attempting to build any predictive model.
